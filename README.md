# Hostel-Management-System

Our Project Titled Digitalized Hostel services using e-hostel platform is a real-world project. Its main objective is to provide an ease to students of the hostels as well as their wardens and hostel staff like security guards and mess administration to do hostel related activities through the online portal. Our project is not an organization centric but could be used by any organization providing hostel facilities. The various segments of our project include E-sign of hostel leave application form by the wardens which would be done by a simple click on accept or reject button, Students Verification using face recognition for security checks, Lost and found feature, Mess food volume prediction which would help in preventing large amount of food wastage. Further it consists of a Hostel Information board and complaint and grievance form for the students. These all features at last will further be combined to form an online portal which would be a website have multiple users-ends like one for the students, other for the wardens and one for the guards and other can also be for mess administration. From that website, all features can be accessed by the various users in Graphical User Interface (GUI). The users of this portal just only need a browser with internet connection to access all the mentioned features and to get maximum benefit out of it.

The Special features of the project are as –

1) Student Verification Using face Recognition –

This feature helps security guards of hostel to check whether the student which is entering into hostel is an actual resident of hostel or not. It works as when a student face is recognized, the guard will immediately get all details about that student on the portal. This ensures the 100% security and protection of that hostel and also make it easier for guards also, not to remember everyone’s face as the number of students are not in hundreds but in thousands , which is a quite tedious and difficult task. This feature will also help mess administration to only permit that students which are subscribed to the mess food and no one can have it for free.

2) E-Sign hostel Leave application form-

By using this feature, a student can send request for signing hostel leave application form to the Warden and by doing so , the warden will get a notification and will receive that student application. Now ,it is up to the warden whether to give permission to the student or not by clicking Accept or Reject button respectively.
This feature ensures in this tough covid-19 times for every student to not make long queues in front of warden room and will get permission from their respective places.

3) Mess Food Volume Prediction-

This feature helps us to predict the volume and quantity in which mess food as to be prepared on different days based on how many students are present in hostel on that day by tracking the record of how many leave application forms are signed by the wardens and at last give the final number of students which are present in hostel for that day to the Mess In-charge , from which he can estimate the quantity of food to be prepared for them and can avoid unnecessary food wastage in the mess.

4) Lost and Found Feature-

Anyone who will found a lost thing of someone and want to return back but not known to whom that thing will belong to, at that time, this feature will help the founder to just upload the photo and details of that particular thing which can be visible to all residents of hostel on portal. The student who lost his/her thing can check on portal whether someone will find his/her lost thing or not and can approach him/her by details posted on portal.
