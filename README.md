# Hostel-Management-System
Our Project Titled Digitalized Hostel services using e-hostel platform is a real-world project. Its main objective is to provide an ease to students of the hostels as well as their wardens and hostel staff like security guards and mess administration to do hostel related activities through the online portal. Our project is not an organization centric but could be used by any organization providing hostel facilities. The various segments of our project include E-sign of hostel leave application form by the wardens which would be done by a simple click on accept or reject button, Students Verification using face recognition for security checks, Lost and found feature, Mess food volume prediction which would help in preventing large amount of food wastage. Further it consists of a Hostel Information board and complaint and grievance form for the students. These all features at last will further be combined to form an online portal which would be a website have multiple users-ends like one for the students, other for the wardens and one for the guards and other can also be for mess administration. From that website, all features can be accessed by the various users in Graphical User Interface (GUI). The users of this portal just only need a browser with internet connection to access all the mentioned features and to get maximum benefit out of it.
